# Lean4 Postgresql Frontend-Backend-protocol

This is mainly a project to learn about practical lean, networking and databases.

The Protocol documentation: [Frontend/Backend Protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/protocol.html)

Heavily relies on [Socket.lean](https://github.com/xubaiw/Socket.lean) for the TCP Socket.

## TODOs

- Include connection to [mathematical relations](https://github.com/hargoniX/lean-hm/blob/master/Hm/Relation.lean)
- Extend query Syntax and TermElab
- Support insert, create table and delete statements
